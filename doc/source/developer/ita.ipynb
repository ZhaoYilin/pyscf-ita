    "Information theory developed by Shannons and others as a branch of applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and computer science is involved in the quantification of information which is often a probability distribution function. Since the electron density is a continuous probability distribution function, as early as in the year of 1980, information theory has been applied to DFT to study atoms and molecules.
