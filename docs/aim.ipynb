    "Another important aspect of the information-theoretic approach is to re-evaluate the above quantities from the perspective of atoms in molecules. To consider atomic contributions of an information-theoretic quantity in a molecular system, three approaches are available to perform atom partitionsin molecules. They are Becke's fuzzy atom approach, Bader's zero-flux AIM approach, and Hirshfeld's stockholder approach. "

For hydrogen, however, Becke suggested a radius of 0.35 $\\text{\\AA}$, somewhat larger than Slater's value of 0.25 $\\text{\\AA}$. Stone argued that using the Bragg-Slater radii in the Becke partitioning \"leads to rather implausible multipole moments (rather large and not in keeping with chemical intuition) though they lead to accurate electrostatic potentials\". For this reason, the default procedure in Stone's GDMA program is to set all the atom radii equal to a value of 0.65 $\\text{\\AA}$, except for hydrogen (to which a value of 0.325 $\\text{\\AA}$ is assigned). According to user's preferences, PAMoC can either use Becke's recipe for atomic size adjustments, or ignore them so that the boundary between neighboring atoms comes halfway between them.\n",

It can be applied to experimental electron densities as well."

    "QTAIM partitioning can be applied either to the molecule in the crystal form, where the atomic basins are defined by the interatomic surfaces (IAS) in the crystal (QCT atoms), or to the molecule extracted from the crystal, whose atoms are separated by interatomic surfaces inside the molecule, but have boundaries artificially moved to infinity outside the molecule. The latter partitioning (hereafter referred as QCT*) gives molecules whose electron densities overlap with one another, so that their electrostatic energies need to be corrected for the penetration energy as in the case of any other type of fuzzy boundary molecules."
